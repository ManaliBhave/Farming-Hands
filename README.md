# Farming Hands

Optimized machine learning model using Python, designed to recommend the most suitable crops based on inputs such as soil pH, potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus content, rainfall, and humidity in the area.
Conducted a comprehensive competitive analysis of various algorithms including Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Classifier, achieving an outstanding accuracy rate of 99.39% with the Random Forest Classifier.
Designed a highly intuitive and user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS, resulting in a 70% reduction in user error rates and enabling farmers to quickly input and output data for efficient crop decision-making. The Farming Hands project has been instrumental in improving crop yields and profitability for farmers, leading to an estimated 25% increase in overall agricultural output.
